# Blockly

Google's Blockly is a web-based, visual programming editor.  Users can drag
blocks together to build programs.  All code is free and open source.

**The project page is https://developers.google.com/blockly/**

#Generators
## JavaScript
Example use: [Generate Javascript from blocks](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/code/index.html)
## Python
Example use: [Generate Python from blocks](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/code/index.html)
## Dart
Example use: [Generate Dart from blocks](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/code/index.html)
## PHP
Example use: [Generate PHP from blocks](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/code/index.html)
## Blockly for Arduino and Genuino
Generate Arduino code usable in the Arduino IDE or [Codebender](http://Codebender.cc)

This code is based on integrating back the work of [BlocklyDuino](https://github.com/BlocklyDuino/BlocklyDuino) into Blockly so as to track Blockly. There are some changes (which might be integrated back into BlocklyDuino if accepted in due time):
+ Fully translatable versions of Arduino Blocks
+ Declaration of variables (int, uint, long, float)
+ Extra functions
+ Write to pins with variables
